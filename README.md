ElectroLab: Physics Simulation with React Flow
Welcome to ElectroLab, a React-based project designed to simulate physics experiments related to electricity using the powerful React Flow library. This project provides an interactive and engaging way for users to practice and understand electrical concepts visually.

🚀 Features
Interactive Simulations: Create and manipulate electrical circuits with drag-and-drop functionality.

Customizable Components: Add resistors, capacitors, wires, and more to your circuit.

Real-Time Feedback: Visualize current flow and calculate voltages instantly.

User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use layout with seamless performance, powered by React and Vite.

Educational Focus: Tailored for students and educators in physics.

🛠️ Built With
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Vite: A fast and modern build tool for web projects.

React Flow: A library for building node-based graphs and diagrams.
